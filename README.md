# RLpong
a pong game with RL thing

the actual RL part sucks, probably idk i trained it for an hour and it didnt improve, though i heard it takes 90 hours. Once while testing it went to the very bottom, where theres a 1/4 chance for it to win lol. idk if this is a weird behavior or if it actually learned this.
